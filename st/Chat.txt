FAB button
OK letâ€™s add the action to it. 

If you are on the `View` tab, the icon on the button will be the 'Edit' icon

If you were on the 'Edit' tab, the icon on the button will be the `View` icon

We want to position the fab button near the vertical centre of the viewport. 


We want to be round  a nice round button


Question:
We are converting the textarea to JSON,

```
1
: 
{type: 'title', content: 'TITLE'}
2
: 
{type: 'update', content: 'UPTDATE'}
...

```
Would it be better to have the JSON object also contain 
the @mentions, #locations, +project items.
