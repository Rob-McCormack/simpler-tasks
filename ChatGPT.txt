This is meant to graph anything,


Why can't I type in textarea?

Please enter default text in textarea, for 10 records,
with random dates and random decreasing weithts between:
2023/1/4:283.1
and
2023/10/31:206
again, give me entire file with everything

I want to type out the weights and dates, on a mobile device.
then translate into format:
{date: '2023/1/4', weight: 283.1},
{date: '2023/1/5', weight: 275},
...

Something like format:
Weight(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/5':275, ...)

Please provide all the code for hml and js



What would be the simplest way to have
dates associated with the numbers, which are actually weight,
in pounds.

labels for
y axis is Weight in pounds
x asis is dates

I meant to have a format like,

(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/4:275 ... to ... 2023/1/4:203)
SimplerGraphs.html

1. set up simple bootstrap 5 template, with CDN
2. Using library https://d3js.org/ 
3. Set up a animated line graph for this data
(283.1, 275, 270, 266, 272, 250, 240, 220, 206,203)


====
We want to summarize the @name and #context, for example

@james
- all items he is resonsible for
@robert
- all items he is response for
etc.

then
#home
- all items that belong to that context
#work
- all items that belong to that context.
