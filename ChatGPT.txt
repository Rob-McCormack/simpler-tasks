Good,  and I made several changes myself,  

Now, although we will allow uses to use `D ` and `H `,
I want the display to always show `d ` and `h `,
We don't want to do this during editting, but only once they click
on `View`
Then, if they return to `Edit`, the special character(s) will be all lower
case








====
We want to summarize the @name and #context, for example

@james
- all items he is resonsible for
@robert
- all items he is response for
etc.

then
#home
- all items that belong to that context
#work
- all items that belong to that context.
