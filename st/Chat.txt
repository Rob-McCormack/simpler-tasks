OK, now we are going to deal with "mentions" and "context" and "projects"

@james is a mentions
#home is a context, in this case a location.
+logodesign is a progect

These can occur anywhere in the list items,


Lets set them up as an array, so we can easily add more...

We want to add simple format for now

@james will be bold
#home will be italic
+logodesign will be  underscore,

Maybe when we set up the array, someting like this:

`
const specialChars = [
    
    { char: "@", meaning: "mentions", format: "<b>" },
    etc.
    
];
`

Or something you feel is better.. Good luck!
I'm open to you improving on this.
