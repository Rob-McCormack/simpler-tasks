A) Trim trailing spaces every where in list
Now we have items such as:
h Buy groceries for the week. 
which has annoying trailing spaces,

How do we TRIM all trailing spaces?

B)Change appearance of first special characters in View:
I want to show the special first characters differently in view,
For example,
 `h Go to Walmart`
 should be 
 <sub>h</sub> Go to Walmart
 and for normal priority
 <sub> </sub> visit with mom
