Here's a rough outline for your new approach:
Read and Parse Input:

Capture the input from the textarea.
Convert the input to a JSON format.
Process Data:

Perform operations on the JSON object (sorting, filtering, categorizing).
Output to View:

Generate HTML based on the processed JSON.
Update the View tab with the new HTML.
Remember to keep your functions small and focused on one task, which will help you maintain and debug your code more easily. Good luck with the rebuild!
