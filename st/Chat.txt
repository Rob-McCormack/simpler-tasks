For our next coding adventure, I never really wanted this `View` presentation of tasks

[must-do] mustdo
[title] My T
[update] UPTDATE
[high priority] high2 +logodesign
[normal] normal1 #home
[normal] normal2 @debbie
[low priority] low1
[low priority] low2
[recurring] rec1 #work
[recurring] rec2
[note] notes1
[note] notes2 @bob

I want to have it sorted by 
TITLE: My Title
Must Do: 
mustdo
Today
-

Do in two parts.

For the formatting of headings of categories,
Would we change this to 
    const specialChars = [
        { char: "!", meaning: "must-do", sortOrder: -2 },
