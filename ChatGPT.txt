No, I will clarify, you know we have a`stMarkDown` function.
I want to add another replacement to it:

This is similar to our `convertToClickableURLs` function...

I want to be able to enter in textarea,
this markdown type of string, will always begin with `image=`:
`image=http://_url_toimage`
and 
have it transforted by the stMarkdown() to:
`image=http://_url_toimage`

For example if the text area has:
`image=https://rob-mccormack.github.io/simpler-tasks/stlogo.png `
The stMarkDown() will trasform it to:
`<img src="https://rob-mccormack.github.io/simpler-tasks/stlogo.png" alt="">`
and then in View, the user will see an image...

Do you understand now?
