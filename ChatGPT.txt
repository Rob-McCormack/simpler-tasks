Let's tackle a few bugs...
---
Sample list:
function initializeSampleTasks() {
    let sampleTasks = `
TITLE: The Big list for BOB  
normal 1 
! item Must do single @robmcc 
h item high1 http://cnn.com #work
l item low1 #home
item normal1 @robmcc
r item recurring1 
t item today1
l item low2  (this is low2 note, note2, note3)
item normal2 @robmcc
r item recurring2  
x item x old @debbie
l item low3 @james
h item high1
t item today2
NOTES:
Notes line 1
Notes line 2
Notes line 3
Notes END
    `;
    let textArea = document.getElementById("initial-list");
    textArea.value = sampleTasks.trim();
}

    `;
    let textArea = document.getElementById("initial-list");
    textArea.value = sampleTasks.trim();
}

a)  Normal catagory has too many items, it should only have 3 items
Normal
item normal 3
item normal1 @robmcc
r item recurring1
item normal2 @robmcc
r item recurring2
NOTES:
Notes line 1
Notes line 2
Notes line 3
Notes END



====
We want to summarize the @name and #context, for example

@james
- all items he is resonsible for
@robert
- all items he is response for
etc.

then
#home
- all items that belong to that context
#work
- all items that belong to that context.
