1. Change appearance of first special characters in View:
I want to show the special first characters differently in view,
For example,
 `h Go to Walmart`
 should be 
 <sub>h</sub> Go to Walmart
 and for normal priority
 <sub> </sub> visit with mom

2. Google Symbols
I want to use
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined" rel="stylesheet" />


The check box symbol is aligned to the TOP of the line height
How do I align horizontally centered this google symbol 
<span class="material-symbols-outlined">check_box_outline_blank</span> Go to Walmart

3. Separation of HTML from JavaScript
If I wanted to use something like
<span class="material-symbols-outlined">check_box_outline_blank</span>
for the checkboxes in View,
would it be an idea to include this somewhere in the HTML file as a hiddent element or template,
rather than trying to write it out with javascript?






<kbd>h</kbd>

      <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
        check_box_outline_blank
      </span>


      <span class="material-symbols-outlined"></span><sub class="text-muted">h</sub>

<span class="material-symbols-outlined text-primary"></span>
