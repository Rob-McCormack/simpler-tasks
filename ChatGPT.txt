a) FIX: I don't think the labels are being read from:
Weight/Dates/line(2023/1/4:283.1 ...)
If I change
Weight
to:
Weightxxx
the y axis label doesn't change

b) 
This is meant to graph anything, with this  super simple format,
Lets add graph type, default will be line graph,
for now, use the same data

g Weight/Dates(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/18:279.5...)
Here is how type will work:

`line` type is default.

Weight/Dates(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/18:279.5...)
is the same as line type graph:
Weight/Dates/line(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/18:279.5...)

line type bar:
Weight/Dates/bar(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/18:279.5...)

For now, just allow 2 types and the default,
Give me ENTIRE code




Why can't I type in textarea?

Please enter default text in textarea, for 10 records,
with random dates and random decreasing weithts between:
2023/1/4:283.1
and
2023/10/31:206
again, give me entire file with everything

I want to type out the weights and dates, on a mobile device.
then translate into format:
{date: '2023/1/4', weight: 283.1},
{date: '2023/1/5', weight: 275},
...

Something like format:
Weight(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/5':275, ...)

Please provide all the code for hml and js



What would be the simplest way to have
dates associated with the numbers, which are actually weight,
in pounds.

labels for
y axis is Weight in pounds
x asis is dates

I meant to have a format like,

(2023/1/4:283.1, 2023/1/4:275 ... to ... 2023/1/4:203)
SimplerGraphs.html

1. set up simple bootstrap 5 template, with CDN
2. Using library https://d3js.org/ 
3. Set up a animated line graph for this data
(283.1, 275, 270, 266, 272, 250, 240, 220, 206,203)


====
We want to summarize the @name and #context, for example

@james
- all items he is resonsible for
@robert
- all items he is response for
etc.

then
#home
- all items that belong to that context
#work
- all items that belong to that context.
