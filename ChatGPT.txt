It worked, great!

Now... I want to change the function of the special first character in task list.

We will no longer user "TODAY" to designate todays task, it will be repaced by `t `

We will use these starting letters (case insensitive) followed by a `space` :

Starting characters folowed by a space:
t for a single TODAY task, displayed as we did with Must-Do Task for Today
! Must do, allowed only one, others will just go in list as high priority 
h High priority
  Normal priority (no character prefix)
l Low priority
x denotes task is DONE, make sure x or X works, case insensitive
