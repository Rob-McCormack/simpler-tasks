a) Great it works !

I noticed that:
In Edit: 
`H high1 @james`
In View:
`h high1 @james`
and then if I click back to Edit, I get  
`h high1 @james`

Which is exaclty what I wanted!

Now...
b)
Something broke along the way,
These are no longer in their own catagory...
`title TITLE`
`update UPTDATE`
They appear in View as `[normal]` like this:
`[normal] title TITLE`
`[normal] update UPTDATE`

Can you fix and be sure
we can handle cases like
`title TITLE`
`Title TITLE`
`TITLE TITLE`

c) Question: Is is it helpfule if I use
`
 to empasis  ` code `
