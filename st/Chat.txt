For our next coding adventure, 
I never really wanted this `View` presentation of tasks
but it was good to build it this way to get started...

[must-do] mustdo
[title] My Title
[update] UPTDATE
[high priority] high2 +logodesign
[normal] normal1 #home
[normal] normal2 @debbie
[low priority] low1
[low priority] low2
[recurring] rec1 #work
[recurring] rec2
[note] notes1
[note] notes2 @bob

Desired presentation of `View`
I wanted to have it grouped and sorted by 
`
[title]:
My Title
[must-do]
mustdo
[high priority]
high1 @james
high2 +logodesign
etc..

Do you understand presenting task items by categories
in `View`?
