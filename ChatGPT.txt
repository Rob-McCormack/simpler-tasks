B) I don't have that function...
I am using `sub` so in View the user doesn't get too confused about their task item, and the special characters

Please add `r ` to the function, this will be a special character for "recurring" tasks, more on that later.
could you not use a list, or array to hold the special charcters,
and loop through them?
I indent to add more.
