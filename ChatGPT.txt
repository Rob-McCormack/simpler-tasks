I want to restrict any image to a maximum of '80px'
I've added this to js:
    // Convert 'image=URL' to '<img src="URL" alt="">'
    text = text.replace(/image=([^\s]+)/g, '<img src="$1" alt="" width="80">');

    Is there are way to set maximum width, like if an image is '32px', it will be shown as '32px',
    but larger images will be reduced to '80px'
